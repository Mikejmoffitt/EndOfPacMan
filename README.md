The End Of Pac-Man
===========
A Python-based Pac-Man clone where you control the ghosts with waypoints.
by Michael Moffitt and Jeff Haak 2012

Pac-Man has reached a dead end in his life and doesn't want to take nothing
from nobody any more! It's now the ghosts' job to hunt down pac-man and have
him calm down just a bit.

You control the ghosts. Pac-Man is doing his own thing. Grab your mouse and 
keyboard.

Press keys 1-4 to select which ghost to control. Click anywhere on the maze
to set a waypoint for the ghost to head to. The ghosts use the same pathfinding
as the original Pac-man game, but your job is to provide intelligence on where
they ought to head. They are not so quick so keep this in mind!

When the ghosts are blue they will ignore your commands and even go against
them, so try to keep Pac-Man away from the big dots. Touch Pac-Man to win the
game. 

This game was made in about 6 combined hours for the CSH game jam.

If it runs too slowly, try increasing FDIV and reducing SCALEVALUE in 
macpan.py. Pygame is not very fast at blitting the maze.

Press F4 while it is running to quit.
